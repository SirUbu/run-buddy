# A Landing Page #
This is an example of the basics I've learned in front-end web development through my certificate program. This page uses the basics of HTML and CSS. It also shows an understanding of links, forms, styling, page layout, and relative paths. 


Recent updates include concepts with mobile responsiveness, flexbot, CSS grid, and more advanced CSS elements.
